1. OpenNIContext is a singleton MonoBehaviour:
	- Update & OnApplicationQuit called directly (without depending on other scripts)
	- Update called only once per frame
	- Proper shutdown of singleton
2. No XML file needed
	- OpenNIContext always opens depth
	- Open any other type of node with OpenNIContext.OpenNode helper function
	- License is hard coded at the moment (shouldn't be this way)
3. Softbar's behave properly regardless of mirror flag
4. Added ImageMapViewer
	- Should only be used as a starting point
	- image is flipped
	- only works when running unity in OpenGL
	- Depends on Tao (install seperately for your platform)
5. Minor code cleanups
